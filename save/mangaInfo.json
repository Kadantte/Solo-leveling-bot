    "description":"Ten years ago, the Gate appeared and connected the real world with the realm of magic and monsters. \n\nTo combat these vile beasts, ordinary people received superhuman powers and became known as Hunters. \nTwenty-year-old Sung Jin-Woo is one such Hunter, but he is known as the World's Weakest, \n\nowing to his pathetic power compared to even a measly E-Rank. Still, he hunts monsters tirelessly in low-rank Gates to pay for his mother's medical bills.",
